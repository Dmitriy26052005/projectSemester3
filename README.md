The Project for Semester 3 of college in Software Systems Development @ SETU.

The goals for this project were massive, and multiple. It uses Kotlin as the main programming language. 
It is similar to Java, however a lot more functional, and the syntax is different. To add to that, IntelliJ was used for this job.
Persistence is also added to the system, so the user doesn't constantly need to create student and course objects.  
During the semester, code was refactored to improve readability and the quality of the code itself. 
The software package, contained multiple features I never knew existed in industry. It's only the tip of the iceberg, as far as tools go.
JUnit tests were written, different models were created for the program to function, and a relationship was formed as well; one-to-many between course and student.

I also started to use different gradle tasks, already implemented in Intellij, for it to form different documentaion, and even generate websites for the methods implemented in the project; very cool!
Different tasks were executed during the process of implementation and development of the project.

As well as that, Github changed my lifestyle in the world of programming. Constant commits on new branches, pull requests, pushes, merges were perfomred during the semester, to be ready for industry standards.
Never to implement or change code on the production branch (master). 

I found this experience, very challenging, but at the same time, extremely important for me as a student in a Software Development environment.

Hope to constantly learn, improve and be the best developer I can.
